Seventeen enhancements are delivered in Java 11 including most notably:

JEP 321 - HTTP Client (Standard): This JEP standardizes the incubated HTTP Client API introduced in JDK 9, via JEP 110, and updated in JDK 10.
JEP 332 - Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3: TLS 1.3 is a major overhaul of the TLS protocol and provides significant security and performance improvements over previous versions.
JEP 328 - Java Flight Recorder (JFR): JFR provides a high-performance flight recording engine and low-overhead data collection framework for troubleshooting mission-critical Java applications.
JEP 333 - Project ZGC: ZGC is an experimental but predictable low-latency garbage collector (GC) that can handle heaps ranging from relatively-small (a few hundreds of megabytes) to very large (many terabytes) in size.
JEP 330 – Launch Single-File Source-Code Programs: This enhancement simplifies the “on-ramp” or new Java users by enhancing the java launcher to run a program supplied as a single file of Java source code, including usage from within a script and/or related techniques.
