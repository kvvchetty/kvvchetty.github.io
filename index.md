## Self File

I am a Software Application Developer. I used programming languages Java8, J2EE, Python, Perl, Jsp, js. I prepared web applications in MVC designs using Angular, Ajax, JQuery, Spring-boot, Hibernate, MySql. I used ETL, Message services, RestAPIs in integration projects. I am doing the application development and support works for 10 plus years now. Fixing errors, making enhancements to the existing applications, migrating from one framework to another framework.

Thank you
